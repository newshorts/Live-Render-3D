BACKGROUND:

This repo contains a library for rendering a live 3D point cloud from an x-box kinect. It's based on the danial schiffman 
library and gets a point data cloud from the kinect. Then it runs the marching cubes algorithm on the point cloud to
render a live 3d mesh of the object in view.

INSTALLATION:

1.	Go to http://iwearshorts.com/blog/bubble-boy/
2. 	Install the necessary scripts.
3. 	Watch the video installation process if it doesn't work.

NEEDS:

Right now it's largely inefficient. It would be nice to clean some of this code up and make it more object oriented. 
Eventually I want to get it to the efficiency level of being able to live 3d render a person with greater detail than 
just a blob.
